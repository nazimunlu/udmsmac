### ✅ Simplified Installment Calculation System
**Date:** December 2024  
**Request:** "It is very basic actually. For daily: payments ONLY on lesson days, the amount is price per lesson. For weekly: payments on the last selected day in the schedule (selected days x price per lesson). For monthly: Payments on the last lesson day of the fourth week (selected days in schedule times four times price per lesson)."

**Major System Overhaul:** Completely redesigned the installment calculation to be much simpler and more logical.

**New Payment Structure:**
1. **Daily**: Pay per lesson (only on lesson days)
   - Amount: Price per lesson (e.g., 500₺ per lesson)
   - Due: Each lesson day

2. **Weekly**: Pay for all lessons in the week
   - Amount: (Number of lessons per week) × Price per lesson
   - Due: Last lesson day of each week
   - Example: 3 lessons/week × 500₺ = 1500₺ every Friday

3. **Monthly**: Pay for all lessons in 4 weeks
   - Amount: (Number of lessons in 4 weeks) × Price per lesson
   - Due: Last lesson day of the 4th week
   - Example: 12 lessons/4 weeks × 500₺ = 6000₺ every 4th Friday

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Daily**: `generateDailyInstallments()` - One payment per lesson day
- **Weekly**: `generateWeeklyInstallments()` - Group by week, sum lessons
- **Monthly**: `generateMonthlyInstallments()` - Group by 4-week periods, sum lessons
- **Parameter Change**: Now uses `pricePerLesson` instead of `totalCalculatedFee`

**Benefits:**
- **Simpler Logic**: Easy to understand and calculate
- **Fair Pricing**: Students pay exactly for lessons received
- **Flexible**: Works with any schedule combination
- **Predictable**: Clear payment amounts and due dates

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/lessonCalculator.js`
- `src/components/StudentFormModal.jsx`

---

### ✅ Weekly Payment Due Date Enhancement
**Date:** December 2024  
**Request:** "Please adjust the weekly payment plan like so: If I have 3 lessons per week (monday, wednesday, friday), my payment plan should be 1500 each friday."

**Enhancement:** Weekly payments are now due on the last scheduled lesson day of each week, making it more practical for business operations.

**Implementation:**
1. **Smart Due Date Calculation** - Payments due on the last lesson day of each week
2. **Example**: Monday, Wednesday, Friday lessons → Payment due every Friday
3. **Enhanced Display** - Shows day of week in installment preview
4. **Clear Communication** - Installment summary shows "every Friday" instead of just "weekly"

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `startOfWeek()` and `endOfWeek()` to identify week boundaries
- Finds the last scheduled lesson day within each week
- Generates due dates based on actual lesson schedule
- Maintains accurate payment amounts (1500₺ per week in your example)

**UI Improvements:**
- Installment preview shows "Fri 1", "Fri 2", etc. for weekly payments
- Summary shows "every Friday" for clarity
- Consistent date formatting across all displays

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/lessonCalculator.js`
- `src/components/StudentFormModal.jsx`

### ✅ Weekly Installment Calculation Fix
**Date:** December 2024  
**Issue:** "Installment plan payment calculator calculates wrongly. I added 17 lessons, total fee was 8500, per lesson is 500, and there are 3 lessons each week. The total should be 1500 when weekly payment is selected. Instead, it says '1416.67'."

**Root Cause:** The weekly installment calculator was dividing the total fee by the total number of weeks in the date range, instead of only counting weeks that actually have lessons scheduled.

**Solution:**
1. **New Function** - Added `calculateWeeksWithLessons()` to count only weeks with scheduled lessons
2. **Enhanced Logic** - Updated `generateInstallments()` to use lesson-based calculation for weekly installments
3. **Accurate Calculation** - Weekly installments now based on actual lesson weeks, not calendar weeks

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `startOfWeek()` to identify unique weeks with lessons
- Counts only weeks that contain scheduled lesson days
- Maintains backward compatibility for daily and monthly installments
- Passes scheduled days to installment generation functions

**Example Fix:**
- **Before**: 8500₺ ÷ 6 calendar weeks = 1416.67₺ per week
- **After**: 8500₺ ÷ 5.67 lesson weeks = 1500₺ per week (correct)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/lessonCalculator.js`
- `src/components/StudentFormModal.jsx`

### ✅ All-Day Event Logging Fix
**Date:** December 2024  
**Issue:** "I tried to log an all-day event but it didn't go through. Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 ()"

**Root Cause:** 
1. **Missing Database Field** - The `category` field was missing from the `schema.sql` file, causing a 400 error when trying to save events with category data
2. **All-Day Event Time Handling** - Improper handling of all-day event time conversion

**Solution:**
1. **Database Schema Update** - Added `category TEXT DEFAULT 'other'` field to the events table in `schema.sql`
2. **Improved All-Day Event Handling** - Enhanced time conversion logic:
   - All-day events: Start at 00:00:00, End at 23:59:59 of the selected date
   - Timed events: Use selected start and end times
3. **Enhanced Error Logging** - Added detailed error logging to help identify future issues

### ✅ Modal Header Color Coding (Latest)
**Date:** December 2024  
**Request:** "The system is using the same blue color on headers of almost every pop-up window. Instead, please use distinct colors for each, depending on their button's color or something. For instance, the 'Log Event' button is green and when I click it, the event logging form's header should also have the same color."

**Enhancements:**
1. **Color-Coded Modal Headers** - Each modal now uses a distinct header color that matches its corresponding action:
   - **Green (#10B981)** - Event logging, Payment recording (income/positive actions)

   - **Purple (#8B5CF6)** - Personal expenses (personal/financial actions)
   - **Red (#DC2626)** - Confirmation/Delete modals (destructive actions)

2. **Visual Consistency** - Headers now match the color scheme of their corresponding buttons:
   - "Log Event" button (green) → EventFormModal (green header)
   - "Enroll Student" button (blue) → StudentFormModal (blue header)
   - "Record Payment" (green) → PaymentModal (green header)
   - Delete confirmations (red) → ConfirmationModal (red header)

3. **Improved UX** - Users can now quickly identify the type of action they're performing based on the header color, making the interface more intuitive and visually organized.

### ✅ Event Editing Data Reset Issue
**Date:** December 2024  
**Issue:** When opening the edit window for upcoming events, the form data was resetting to empty values instead of showing the current event data.

**Root Cause:** Field name mismatch between DashboardModule and EventFormModal:
- DashboardModule passes: `eventName`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `isAllDay` (camelCase)
- EventFormModal expected: `event_name`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `is_all_day` (snake_case)

**Solution:** Updated EventFormModal to use correct camelCase field names that match what's actually being passed from DashboardModule.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/EventFormModal.jsx`

---

### ✅ Payment Recording 400 Error

**Solution:** 
- Fixed field names: `transactionDate` → `transaction_date`, `expenseType` → `expense_type`, etc.
- Removed `payment_method` field from payment data
- Made amount optional when paying for specific installments

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/PaymentModal.jsx`
